The Love Invasion began as a Toronto-based grassroots initiative, featuring the deployment of 100 hand-cast concrete Lovebot sculptures. Acting as a unique and meaningful social objects placed in the paths of pedestrians, each Lovebot sculpture was dedicated to a person or group that performed a powerful act of kindness in their community. The purpose: to illuminate the kindness and compassion in our city and, inspire more.

 Following years of dedication from Lovebot creator Matthew Del Degan along side his strong team of volunteers and the ever-growing Lovebot community, Lovebot's  movement continues to gain outstanding momentum. Lovebot stickers and posters are now displayed in locations around the world, made possible by Lovebot’s devoted and active leaders wishing to spread kindness.
In addition, due to the recent success of the D.I.Y Lovebot crowd-funding campaign, the first ever Lovebot toy is soon to be released as a platform that Lovebot fans can customize and share with the intention to foster creativity and kindness in all of us.

By placing something meaningful and unique in people’s paths, Lovebot creates an impactful and uplifting experience. With constant social initiatives and methods for others to join the Love Invasion movement, Lovebot continues to inspire others to love more and get involved in making this world a better place.
